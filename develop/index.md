## Contributing

XCSoar is a free software project, that is run by many volunteers in their free time.  
If you would like to help, here are a few things you can do:

- **Development**: Can you speak C++? The [XCSoar Developer Manual]({{ site.download_server_url }}/{{ site.xcsoar_stable_version }}/XCSoar-developer-manual.pdf) has instructions on how to get the source code, hack it, and submit your patches.  You can contact other developers here [here](/contact/).
- **Testing**: Download XCSoar, test it, and [report bugs](/develop/new_ticket.html).
- **Documentation**: Can you edit in Latex? We need editors for the XCSoar manual. It is outdated, and needs some care. See the final section of the XCSoar Developer Manual mentioned above for instructions on how to edit the manuals.
- **Translation**: Check our [Launchpad page](https://translations.launchpad.net/xcsoar/trunk) if you want to help.
