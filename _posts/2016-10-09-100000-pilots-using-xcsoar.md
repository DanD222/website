According to
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xcsoar)
statistics, there are now more than 100,000 pilots flying with XCSoar
on Android.  (We do not know how many people downloaded XCSoar
anonymously from this website.)

When I announced the
[50,000 pilots mark two years ago](/discover/2014/06/04/50000-pilots-using-xcsoar.html),
I thought our growth would be over eventually, and I could not imagine
we would ever reach 100,000 pilots.  Here we are, even more proud of
our success!
